## DATA SET DESCRIPTION

### Data Set Information
Predicting the age of abalone from physical measurements. The age of abalone is decided by
cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the amount of rings through a
microscope an uneventful and time-consuming task. Other measurements, which are easier to
get, are wont to predict the age. Further information, like weather patterns and site (hence
food availability) could also be required to unravel the matter.

### Attribute Information
Given is the attribute name, attribute type, the measurement unit and a brief description. The
number of rings is the value to predict either as a continuous value or as a classification
problem.

### Name / Data Type / Measurement Unit / Description
Sex / nominal / -- / M, F, and I (infant)
Length / continuous / mm / Longest shell measurement
Diameter / continuous / mm / perpendicular to length
Height / continuous / mm / with meat in shell
Whole weight / continuous / grams / whole abalone
Shucked weight / continuous / grams / weight of meat
Viscera weight / continuous / grams / gut weight (after bleeding)
Shell weight / continuous / grams / after being dried
Rings / integer / -- / +1.5 gives the age in years
